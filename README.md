# testingExpressJsForBackEnd

I am currently learning Express Js for backend development. I am using this repository to test my knowledge and skills. 
I hope to learn more about Express Js and Node Js in general.
And I hope to be able to use this knowledge to build a full stack application in the future.
And this will help me to easily learn other backend frameworks like Django, Laravel, etc. and building an API.
