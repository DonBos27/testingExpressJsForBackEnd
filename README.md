# testingExpressJsForBackEnd

I am currently learning Express Js for backend development. I am using this repository to test my knowledge and skills. 
I hope to learn more about Express Js and Node Js in general.
And I hope to be able to use this knowledge to build a full stack application in the future.
And this will help me to easily learn other backend frameworks like Django, Laravel, etc. and building an API. 

## What I have learnt so far
- How to create a server using Express Js
- How to create routes
- How to use middleware
- used `cors` middleware to allow cross origin requests


## What I am yet to learn

- How to use a template engine with Express Js
- How to use a form with Express Js
- How to use a form validation with Express Js
- How to use authentication with Express Js
- How to use authorization with Express Js
- How to use cookies and sessions with Express Js
- How to use file upload with Express Js
